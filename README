MIPS32 based Processor
======================

Creating a basic processor seems to be a very good way of practicing Digital Design, Computer Architecture and at the same time learning more about System Verilog. 

The implementation will consist in a multicycle instruction design and with a reduced instruction set based on MIPS I.
